# The Climate Change AIctivist

## Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered chatbot providing informed and accurate information on climate change. The bot assists users in understanding complex climate-related topics, leveraging data from various authoritative sources.

## Data Sources
The foundation of this project includes academic research papers and data from the Global Environmental Outlook. The data collection process is essential but not detailed in this documentation.

## Data Preprocessing
Significant effort was dedicated to manual preprocessing of data, mostly in PDF format. This involved removing formatting artifacts and converting data into a text format suitable for AI processing. Details are in `[placeholder_notebook_name]`.

## Data Summarization and Question Generation
Utilizing the GPT-3.5 API, the project involved:
1. **Summarization**: Summarizing each paragraph to distill essential information, focusing on general climate change concepts.
2. **Question Generation**: Generating questions based on the summarized data to create a diverse question-answer pair collection.

## Model Training and Fine-Tuning
The project used a pre-trained Zephyr7b model, fine-tuned with `[placeholder number]` question-answer pairs. This tailored the model specifically for climate change topics.

## Current Status and Next Steps
The chatbot has undergone initial training and is in early testing stages. Future work includes evaluation, improvements, and expanding the knowledge base.

## Project Goals
The goal is to create a resource for understanding climate change, making complex environmental information digestible for a broad audience through advanced AI technology.


Project Goals
The ultimate goal of this project is to create an accessible and reliable resource for individuals seeking to understand climate change better. By leveraging advanced AI technologies, this chatbot aims to make complex environmental information more digestible and engaging for a wide audience.
